# To-do List App built w/ Web3 🦄

(Demo Link)[]

In my journey to learn more about building dApps I decided to do a basic To-do list App
in order to ensure basic CRUD functionality.

- You can view your to-do list
- You can add a to-do item
- Complete item (update)
- And finally you can delete a to-do list item


This project is build w/ React & Hardhat and is deployed on the Rinkeby Testnet
